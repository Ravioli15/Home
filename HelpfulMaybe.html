<!--Here's a file with as many quick and basic vocab terms and explanations of html as I can think of.
It's not as much as it looks, but before you look at it, various different pages on this site can probably
Explain it even better than me if you have the energy to look https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp-->

<!DOCTYPE html> 

<!-- "<!DOCTYPE html>" is the doctype declaration or DTD. It tells your computer 
that the following code is written in HTML5, the most current version of HTML which was released in late 2014.
It won't make a difference or even show up in your page, so all you need to know about it is that every good webpage
starts with it and it will make everyone happy if you remember it.-->

<!--This greenish text is greenish because its a comment. A comment is any text written in the code
that isn't read by the computer. It's meant exclusively to be seen by human eyes. If you want to write
yourself a reminder you can write it in a comment by creating "<!--" and everything following it will be a comment
until you put  "-->"

<!-- "tags" are the words or acronyms at the beginning and end of all your data that are enclosed in angle brackets.
So "<html>" is a tag "<head>" is a tag the div elements that should make up most of your body are in "<div>" tags, etc.
In most cases, a start tag is eventually followed by an end tag that has a "/" after the first angle bracket.
example: <div> pets are cool </div> 

An element is everything from one start tag to its end tag. In the previous example, you could say "pets are cool"
is the element, or "pets are cool belongs to that particular div element"

It's normal to put whole elements inside of other elements, and often necessary to make certain effects.
example: <div> <center> This is centered text </center> </div>

		< = angle brackets
		( = round bracket or simply parenthesis
		{ = curly bracket, squiggly bracket, or braces. People call them all three. Call them whatever you prefer.

The following tags are arranged in the most basic structure of an html file:

<html>
	<head>
		<title> Page title here </title>
		<style> Page Layout Data here </style>		NOTE: if the html file is connected to a stylesheet, then instead of two style tags,
	</head>											there will be a link to the stylesheet, or CSS file
													example: <link rel="stylesheet" href="petstyle.css">
	<body>											"CSS" stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" btw
		<div>
		body element 1
		</div>

		<div>
		body element 2
		</div>
	</body>
</html>

Indentation is very important for improving the "readability" of your code. If you indent well, it will make it easier
for other programmers to read your code. When you put one element inside of another, indent it. If two tags are both in
the same element at the same level, like the div elements in the above example, don't indent. If you do it correctly, your
page should resemble a nice heirarchy of tags.-->

<html>
	<head>
		<title> BoringVetNotes </title>
		<style>
		
		.bob {
			background-color:red;		<!--NOTE: Make sure when you're adding attributes to a class between the style tags that you put a semicolon ";"-->
			color:yellow;				<!-- after every one-->
		}
		
		.yomama {
			background-color:green;
		}
		
		</style>		
	</head>
				
	<body>
		<div style= "background-color:blue">
		body element 1
		</div>

		<div class="bob">
		body element 2
		</div>
		
		<div class="yomama" style= "font-size:50px">
		body element 3
		</div>
		<br><br><br><br><br><br> <!--NOTE: "<br>" is a special tag that creates a space. Or many spaces if you use many. It's unique in that it doesn't-->
		<hr>						<!--require an end tag. "<hr>"creates a line and also doesn't need an end tag. They both come in handy, but mostly <br>-->
		<div>
		holy shit more text.
		</div>
	</body>
</html>

<!--In the above html there are examples of two different ways to add CSS to your file. The first is called "Inline CSS"
This part  <div style="background-color:red"> showed Inline CSS, which is placed right inside the opening tag before the closing angle bracket.

The second div element  <div class="bob">  used what's called "Embedded CSS." Inside the opening div tag, the class is defined as bob,
so all of the styling in the .bob class inside the style tags applies to that element.

The third div uses both. you can experiment with some other stuff like adding "border: 5px solid black" or "text-align:center" or "width:40px" or
"margin: 10px" or "padding: 200px" or "float:right" or 

The part of CSS that describe exactly how to modify your elements are either called "attributes" and "modifiers"
example: <tag class="classname" style="attribute:modifier:>

There is also external CSS, which links your html file to a CSS file and is the preferred way to use CSS, 
but I don't feel like explaining that right now. https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp That page explains it.

Seriously though, w3school has everything you need to know about hmtl and more. It'll show you how to make pictures
and move stuff around and everything with examples. Check it out at some point.
