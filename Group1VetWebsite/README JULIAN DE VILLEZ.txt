Updated Veterinary Website

This folder contains a collection of static pages designed to resemble a straightforward and easy to use prototype website for clients of the Vet Surgery "Harrison Pets"

hpets2.html is the homepage, and all other pages can be linked to from the sidebar menu.

The "News.html" is our required table style webpage.

You'll notice for every file in the folder there is a second with nearly the same title, e.g. "hpets.html" and "hpets2.html" The former file will contain the page content and the latter connects it to the sidebar menu file and will open the page with the sidebar. This is why "hpets2.html" is the homepage

You may also notice the image for Rukia and kath on the first page is the same picture. This is something of an intentional joke, as the case study mentioned nothing to distinguish the two; Meaning for all intents and purposes of this project they're same person with the same stakeholder representation. heheh.

Other than that everything should be straightforward.
