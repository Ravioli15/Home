			<b>Local Dogs and Cats Are Heros For Donating Blood</b><br>

			Thanks to the local cats and dogs whose owners are devoted to saving other pets' lives, Harrisons veterinary practice has been able to save many pets with blood transfusions. Harrisons veterinary blood banks are always looking for more animal donors to help save lives. If interested, call in and set up an appointment<br>
			<br>

			<b>Seasonal Pet Allergies On the Rise With Spring Approaching</b><br>

			With the days warming up and plants in bloom, many animals will start to experience allergies. Allergies are often missed by pet owners because they dont know what symptoms to look for and often think animals have the same symptoms as humans when experiencing allergies. With animals, allergies are more likely to affect their skin. If they are scratching or licking their skin often around spring time, allergies might be to blame. There are some steps you can take to help reduce or prevent allergies for your pets. You can bathe your pet at least once a week to remove allergens caught in fur, wipe your pet's paws when they come inside to remove pollen, give them Omega-3 fatty acid supplements to help keep their skin healthy, keep them inside while you mow, use the air-conditioner to filter the pollen and prevent it from settling on surfaces, you can use allergy medications but must check with a veterinarian first.<br>

			<b>Harrisons Microchipping Reunites Family With Dog</b><br>

			Every year, less than 20 percent of the 8 million animals in local shelters are ever reunited with their original owners. Microchipping your pet is the best way to be able to find your missing pet. Microchipping only takes a few minutes where we will use a needle to place an identification chip in the animals shoulder area. The microchip is a tiny, radio-frequency transponder which is programmed to link your pet with your home address and contact information. Call or set up an appointment so you are able to be reunited with your lost pet like the Prim family and their beloved dog, Doug.<br>

			<b>Some Dangers of Over-the-Counter Medications</b><br>

			Many over the counter medications are sold at pharmacies and grocery stores that we assume are safe for pets. Some of these medications can actually be harmful or even fatal to pets. Sometimes human medications are used which dont always work the same for humans and pets. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) are one of the most common classes of dangerous medications used which can very easily be a fatal mistake for your pet. These medications include Tylenol, Aleve, Advil and others. These medications create toxic chemicals in the animals body as they are not metabolized the same as they are for humans. Kidney failure, stomach ulcers, and liver failure are some of the problems that can occur. If NSAIDs are ingested, take your pet to the vet straight away. Its important to discuss and medication you are giving your pet, with your veterinarian first.<br>
